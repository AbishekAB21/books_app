This is a machine test that was assigned to me by EIT Global

## About the app

This is a basic books appliction built using Flutter/Dart. The data being displayed has been fetched from Google's Books API. The Home screen lists all the available books.
When you click on a particular book, it takes you to a Detail Screen that gives you a more clear idea about the book and an option to buy it. There is also an Authors Screen,
that lists out various authors and also has an option to add new users if needed.
